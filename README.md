This project shows a website with basic information about myself and past experience with web development tools.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, ul, li, and a selectors. I also created rules for different div sections. The rules specified things like height, width, margins, padding, background colors, font colors and sizes, and display type. Essentially, the rules just make sure that I can create neat sections placed exactly where I like them. I found it difficult at times to place sections exactly where I wanted them, and so I often found it easier to just add redundancy by specifying more margins than necessary, adding more padding than needed, etc. I created a "button" by adding rules for links, and changed how the button looks when it's hovered over. To implement these rules, I referenced code from past projects I made, and I often referenced the website https://www.w3schools.com/  for refreshers on how to create and implement certain items. 
- **Java Script Animation**: I created a simple animation that moves a solid block down the screen. To do so, I followed instructions and implemented code from the following sources: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_animate.asp and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdoPQA2GNXY. I had to go through a bit of trial and error to get this part to work, and the solution ended up being that I needed to move where I put the script tag.
- **Semantic HTML Tags**: I included a header, nav, table, link, and section tags as part of using semantic HTML tags. The header and nav are included at the tops of the page and have specified rules in the CSS file. I used the section tag to create side bars on the page, and to create a middle section of the page where my table could go. I used this table to make a row of information in neat boxes. The link is used to create a button back to the home page, which isn't very useful right now, but could be if more pages were added to the site. Once again, I referenced past code of mine, and https://www.w3schools.com/.  

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Rubik Font from Google Fonts**: I used Rubik as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- **Used color palette made with Adobe**: I included the color palette using Adobe's color tool in my site.
